# kenzie-portfolio

## Description

I was tasked with creating a portfolio page with interactive elements such as a photos that link to deployed projects, and a responsive layout.  While we were not supposed to have starter code, there was starter code available to me in the homework folder.  I studied the flexbox properties and media queries within this code, and edited and updated it to fit my portfolio instead.  The starter code allowed me to focus on these qualities and play with them to see how it changed the design.  By doing this project, I gained a much more thorough understanding of how flex properties and media queries can be manipulated.  I was also able to learn more about hover mechanics.  This portfolio allows me to display my deployed projects (or at least set up the ability to do so) and it gave me experience.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
